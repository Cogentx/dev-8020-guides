# 80-20 Guide to HTML

## HTML - HyperText Markup Language

The **content** and **structure** of websites

JavaScript, together CSS and JS, form the **building blocks of the web**

You can create a functioning website with only HTML

- but it would be very boring!!!

Modern HTML is designed to be Semantic

In other words, while some tags such `<div>` offer structural dividers, most tags convey a purpose. They tell the browser, as well as screen readers, etc. what type of content is contained within the tags (e.g. header, footer, navigation, headings, sub-headings, paragraph, and strong/bold)
