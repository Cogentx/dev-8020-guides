## HTML - File Naming and Organization

### File Naming Conventions

- Keep file names short
- File names should be descriptive
  - 'page2.html' vs. 'about-us.html'
- No Spaces
  - if space desired then use ` - ` or ` _ `
- Use all lowercase
  - although the browser will except names with caps such as 'About-Us.html' you may inadvertantly create links that do not work since 'About-Us.html' and 'about-us.html' are two different page destinations to the browser.

### File Organization

- The main folder is called 'root'
- The homepage must be 'index.html'
- 'index.html' must be in the 'root' folder
  - everything else can be in sub-folders
  - images, especially, should be in a separate folder.
