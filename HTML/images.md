It's generally considered bad practice to just link off to other websites because depending on the site they may block your request; may block after so many requests or possibly return a placeholder image.

If you want placeholder image, there are good sites for this purpose.

**alt** tag

images are not considered valid without an  ` alt `  tag.

describe the image - focus on intent of image and why is it included

if the image is decorative text or logo it does not require any description in the ` alt ` tag but it still requires the ` alt ` tag with empty quotes

` <img src="myLogo.png" alt="" > `

Don't need closing bracket to have slash but you can - both are same:

` <img src="cat" alt="cute cat" > `
` <img src="cat" alt="cute cat" /> `
