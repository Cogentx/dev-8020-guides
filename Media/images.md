## Images

### Internet Challenges with Images

- too big
- width / height not right (ratio)
- poor loading perf
- not the right format (lots of formats)
- not compressed

#### Lossless Compression

Makes image as small as possible without loosing any quality

#### Lossy Compression

Makes image as small as possible but does give up some of the quality
