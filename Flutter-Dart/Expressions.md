### Expressions

#### Modulus

The expression  ` i ~/ 2 `  divides  ` i `  by 2 and returns an integer result. For example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 becomes 0, 1, 1, 2, 2. This calculates the actual number of word pairings in the ListView, minus the divider widgets, which allows us to retrieve ten word-pairs if that's our goal rather than half that number (five in this example).
