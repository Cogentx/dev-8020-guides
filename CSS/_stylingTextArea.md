# Styling TextArea

see images for section 03|07 (12/01/2020)

TextArea has default border so you can make rounded corners with just border-radius

Button also has default border so you can make rounded corners with just border-radius

notice the `border: unset` to get rid of TextArea and Button default border

`margin-left: 75%` to move button left
