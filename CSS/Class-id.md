# Using Classes vs IDs for styling

IDs can only be used once per page.

Classes can be used once or as many times as you need.

**It is strongly recommended that for styling purposes to use only CLASSES**
Why? Helps reduce errors plus if you only use class once but then something changes and you want to use it again... you can.  Whereas with IDs you'd have to make additional changes to convert from ID.


## Naming

- don't use spaces in name
- you can use ` - ` or ` _ ` or **camelCase** but generally use ` - `
- pick one style and stick with it in a codebase
